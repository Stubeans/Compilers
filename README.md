# Compilers
A repository to hold the compiler code I will build for my Compilers CMPT 432 class.

Project 1 is seperated from Main via the 'Project 1' branch

Project 2 is seperated from Main via the 'Project 2' branch

Project 3 currently resides in the main branch.

to run the Compiler, access this main directory ( DO NOT GO INTO SOURCE ) and run:

javac source/*.java

java source/Compiler.java -input-here-

:IMPORTANT NOTE:

Whatever file path you enter in place of -input-here-, please use / slashes, instead of \ slashes.
Example:
java source/Compiler.java Progs/testCases.txt

: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING :

WARNING: Project 3 works as much in my code as it does in my head, ie: not at all.
If You are reading this as is, Project 3 is not close to being functional, and I am hard at work desperately trying to find a way to fix it.
I'll try to save you some time and agree that this is worth 0 points.

While I do produce an extremely limited AST, it is no wheres near helpful. I also have no symbol table production implemented.
