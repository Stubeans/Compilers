# Compilers
A repository to hold the compiler code I will build for my Compilers CMPT 432 class.

Project 1 is seperated from Main via the 'Project 1' branch

Project 2 is seperated from Main via the 'Project 2' branch

Project 3 is seperated from Main via the 'Project 3' branch

to run the Compiler, access this main directory ( DO NOT GO INTO SOURCE ) and run:

javac source/*.java

java source/Compiler.java -input-here-

:IMPORTANT NOTE:

Whatever file path you enter in place of -input-here-, please use / slashes, instead of \ slashes.
Example:
java source/Compiler.java Progs/testCases.txt

: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING :

At the moment Project 4 is mostly complete. To my knowledge all integer functions work as intended, most if not all string functions work as intended, and booleans are partially implemented. Boolops are the only part of booleans not entirely implemented as far as I am aware.
