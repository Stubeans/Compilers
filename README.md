# Compilers
A repository to hold the compiler code I will build for my Compilers CMPT 432 class.

Project 1 is seperated from Main via the 'Project 1' branch

to run the Compiler, access this main directory ( DO NOT GO INTO SOURCE ) and run:

javac source/Compiler.java

java source/Compiler.java -input-here-

:IMPORTANT NOTE:

Whatever file path you enter in place of -input-here-, please use / slashes, instead of \ slashes.
Example:
java source/Compiler.java source/testCases.txt

LEXER needs spacing to work correctly.
